                    <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft">Water is an essential element of life on this planet. It is composed of two hydrogen atoms and 
                        one oxygen atom, and its special properties help sustain much of the life on this planet. One aspect of water is pH. pH is the measure 
                        of how acidic or basic a substance is, and is based on the concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions. The scale goes from 0 to 14, 
                        with 0 being basic and 14 being acidic (USGS). A common acid is acetic acid, which was shown in a study to degrade certain substances 
                        including OPS (oil palm shell) concrete (Ajay et al., 2020). A common base is sodium bicarbonate, which was shown in a study to reduce 
                        acidosis during exercise, and is often used as performance-enhancing aid (Hadzic et al., 2019). The pH of water can affect many of its 
                        properties. A study in Beijing showed that the lower the pH in sewer water, the higher the release rate of heavy metals (Li et al., 2013). 
                        When the pH is lower, it increases the mobility of the metal and makes H+ occupy more absorption sites, and makes the metals more soluble. 
                        In other words, the lower the pH, the more soluble the heavy metals are in that water. Heavy metals also affect the properties of the water 
                        it is in. Heavy metals are metallic elements that have a high density, and examples include aluminum, lead, and mercury (Helmenstine, 2021). 
                        Flow rate is the volume of a liquid (in this case water) per unit of time that passes through a point in an area (Toppr). Most flow rates 
                        are measured using a flow meter, which is a machine that usually has some sort of turbine that turns as a liquid passes through it. A study
                        done in the Philippines showed that the highest flow rate was observed during the wet season at low tides, while the lowest flow rate was 
                        observed during the dry season at high tides (Paronda et al., 2019). This study shows that the lowest flow rate occurred during the dry 
                        season because of the presence of heavy metals. In other words, heavy metals slow down the flow of the water that it is in. Many other 
                        factors affect flow rate as well, including the type of fluid, the temperature, and the size of the pipe. Another study done in the Mara 
                        Basin of Kenya showed that the flow speed of water is dependent on the rate at which water enters the area, and the slope of the area 
                        (Wekesa et al., 2020).

                    <p class="lead overview-font ovPadRight">From prior research and studies, it is known that the change in the pH of water changes the solubility 
                        of heavy metals in it and that heavy metals slow down the flow rate of water. This research attempts to answer the question of how pH affects 
                        the flow of water with heavy metals in it, specifically aluminum.
                        This is an important question to ask because it deals with the topic of climate change. Over the years, climate change has been impacting people’s 
                        lives and will continue to change the planet in drastic ways if people don’t take action. A study done on the Greenland Ice Sheet showed that the 
                        glacier was retreating at a much faster rate since the beginning of the 2000s than before (King et al., 2020). Climate change also affects the topic 
                        and question in this project as well. A study done in the Georgia Basin showed that the greater the runoff from melting glaciers and snow covers, 
                        the more the pH of surface waters will change through natural acidification (Strang & Aherne, 2015). One of the big effects of climate change is 
                        the melting of glaciers at the poles, and in other areas. This runoff changes the pH of surface waters. Answering the research question in this 
                        project is important to show how this change in pH due to the melting can affect the environment because of the possible change in water flow. 
                        This project could lead the way to much more research to investigate more about the properties of water. This would lead to many advancements in the 
                        field of limnology (the study of water), and change people’s understanding of the environment and the world. Scientists would have a much better 
                        understanding of the environment with this project, and how people should interact with it. If pH does affect the flow of water with heavy metals, 
                        people could know how climate change and other factors could promote the change of pH, and gain more knowledge of how changing water flow can affect 
                        certain factors and organisms. A review article on fish migration in rivers states that water flow affects the migration of fish, both when they 
                        migrate and their intensity (Jonsson, 1991). More research could be done on figuring out more properties of water, and how they affect the world.

                    <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft">The research hypothesis is that since heavy metals slow the 
                        flow of the water it is in, and the lower pH of liquids dissolves heavy metals, the lower the pH 
                        of water with aluminum in it, the higher its flow speed is. The prediction for this experiment is 
                        that when the pH of the water with aluminum in it is lowered and put through the flow meter, its 
                        flow speed will increase, and vice versa. The experiment that was performed includes the independent 
                        variable of the pH of the water and the dependent variable of the flow speed of the water. The experiment 
                        conducted helped show how the pH of water with aluminum in it affects its flow speed.
